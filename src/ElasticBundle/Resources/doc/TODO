- Generic Population
- ORM Population Helpers
- XML service configuration
- Improve configuration (more error checking and defaults)
- Alias support
- Rolling zero-downtime repopulation (via aliases)
- Bulk insert/update/delete
- Deffered synchronization on kernel.terminate, command.terminate
- Generic synchronization events/event listener (onUpdate, onCreate, onDelete) for manual sync
- Resetting of single type
- Logging configuration of elastica client
- Additional logging
- Events for major operations
- CLI Commands:
    - Querying
    - Get status (indexes created? mapping in sync?)
- Tests :D
- Check if type is defined in Index::getType

- Problem:
  Transformers and synchronizers do not accept subclasses of their configured entity classes because
  for performance they index arrays by class names. This could be fixed by iterating in over all
  synchronizers/transformers and checking is_a().
