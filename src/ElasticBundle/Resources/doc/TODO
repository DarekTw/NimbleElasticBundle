- Generic Population
- ORM Population Helpers
- XML service configuration
- Improve configuration (more error checking and defaults)
- Alias support
- Rolling zero-downtime repopulation (via aliases)
- Bulk insert/update/delete
- Deffered synchronization on kernel.terminate, command.terminate
- Generic synchronization events/event listener (onUpdate, onCreate, onDelete) for manual sync
- Resetting of single type
- Logging configuration of elastica client
- Additional logging
- Events for major operations
- CLI Commands:
    - Querying
    - Get status (indexes created? mapping in sync?)
- Tests :D
- (idea/refactor) Transformers should not be used in SynchronizerManager directly but rather collected and used
  through a Transformer service which will decide which transformer to use.
- Register:
    - indexes with IndexManager
    - Synchronizations with SynchronizerManager
    - Transformers with TransformerManager
  using service tags and compiler passes.
- Check if type is defined in Index::getType
